# Machine Learning

Introduction:
First you must import your data into R

Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.
Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.

Once you have the tidy data first step is to transform (calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)) the data.
Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling, because getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often feels like a fight!

Two main engines of knowledge generation:
visualisation and modelling

Visualisation is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualisation might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualisations can surprise you, but don’t scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them.

Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. Even when they don’t, it’s usually cheaper to buy more computers than it is to buy more brains! But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you.

last step of data science in communication. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualisation have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.

data exploration is the art of looking at your data, rapidly generating hypothesis, quickly testing them, then repeated again and again and again.
